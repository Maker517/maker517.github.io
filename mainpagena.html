<a>My net art project is very much inspired by the various routes off the Florida highway system. 
    Growing up in Central Florida made me very fond of where to go. 
    Given that it's a popular city to visit, people can get very familiar traveling down there from place to place. 
    My best advice is to always have a route home and personally,
    to have all the options on the table. My plan once I understood more what needed to be brought in was to bring the net art to life. 
    VThrough the series of GIFs and researched images, the pages begin to flow together in my head. 
    I wanted the web collage to have symmetry. style="position: fixed; left: 4460px; top: 200px"></a>
